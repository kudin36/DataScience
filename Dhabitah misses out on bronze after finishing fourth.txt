By LIM TEIK HUAT


PETALING JAYA: Nur Dhabitah Sabri pulled off a delightful surprise for Malaysia by finishing a strong fourth in the women's individual 3m springboard competition at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre.

The 22-year-old was a picture of consistency throughout all five dives in the final to finish with 326.15 points in her pet event.

Dhabitah was competing in her first Olympics final in the 3m springboard individual but kept her nerves in check with 63.00, 66.65, 61.50, 67.50 and 67.50.

It is the best ever performance by a Malaysian diver in the individual final after Pandelela Rinong's bronze winning effort in the 10m platform event at the 2012 London Olympics.


Dhabitah was making her second Olympics campaign in Tokyo.

In her Tokyo debut, the Kuala Lumpur-born diver made it to the 10m platform individual final where she finished ninth.

United States diver Krysta Palmer got the bronze with 343.75 points.

Shi Tingmao defended the title she won in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 with 383.50 points while teammate Wang Han got the silver for China as well with 348.75.

It will be the turn of Pandelela Rinong and Cheong Jun Hoong to compete in the women's 10m platform individual preliminary round on Wednesday.
